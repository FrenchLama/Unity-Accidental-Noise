Accidental Noise Library for C# & Unity
========

Based on the original [Accidental Noise Library](http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/) by [Joshua Tippetts](http://tippettsj.users.sourceforge.net/)

C# port written by [James of Discord Games](http://discordgames.com/?p=1954) also at 

Packaged and examples scenes for [Unity](http://unity3d.com) by me.

##### Note: Unfinished Port

Many of the various color functions are not yet ported. If you're familiar with the C++ version, I'm sure the Unity community would very much appreciate your contribution to finishing the work started by James.


## Minecraft Worlds
Examples outlined in Joshua's [Minecraft Worlds](http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/minecraftworlds.html) article forÂ compositing various layers of noise together.

## Todo ##
Please feel free to contribute, below are some things that need doing:

* **Finish Port** - As noted above, many functions are still missing. This is highest priority.
* **Noise Recipe Builder** - Some sort of simple Unity editor for building noise combinations without touching the code
* **Additional preset examples** - Got some recipes with interesting results?
